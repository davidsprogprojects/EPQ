{Right in front of boss door}
Okay i cannot let you through here.
It seems i massively underestimated you and refuse to be proven wrong by a human of all things.
Guess im just gonna have to do this then:
{teleports you to starting room}
If i keep teleporting you back here then you can never prove me wrong and i will never be wrong.
Hahahaha

WHAT DO YOU THINK YOURE DOING
This is meant to be a fair trial of a new sin and youre breaking the rules.
What do you have to say for yourself?

I have so few people to torture down in hell in comparison to heaven, Its just so unfair!

Well thats because humans were created to be a good species and only occasionally do they fall from the light.

I just wanted my numbers to go up a little bit!

Too bad, you have rigged this trial and as a result im sending you back down again, NOW!

{The devil mopes off}

Sorry about that, Heres the door that you earned your way to.

{Door appears in exit}

Anyway, good luck again! Youve done really well, we picked a good representative of your kind.
