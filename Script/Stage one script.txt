I realised we didnt really explain this very well so im going to try again.
Basically your going to have to fight the living embodiment of fear.
Now, everyone has fears and its completely normal so making fear a reason to be sent down under would be a terrible idea,
That is why im going to help you win by giving you this ___.
{Tutorial on using __}
With that item the battle will be incredibly easy as long as you avoid all of his attacks.
Anyway, i best be off, good luck with the fight, even though you wont need it.
