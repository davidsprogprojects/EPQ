What's the matter??.You said we needed to see them in action and the.easiest way to do that is with one of your humans.
I promise i will protect them from dying.*under breath* I'm not saying anything about injuries though..
Shut up, theyre waking up.
Why do you need to ask them that?.Aren't you meant to be all knowing?.
It doesn't even matter, lets just get on with this.
Do I have to?
Stop asking them questions and just explain already!
And you are the lucky human that gets to fight it in order to. prove themselves to us,and show us whether we can recruit.them (to help bring my numbers up)..
You were taking too long.
Doesn't matter, bye!
Oops too late.
You tell me.
Im looking forward to this!
